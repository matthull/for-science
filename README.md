For Science!
===========


For Science! is a protoype based on the Crafty.js game engine. Currently the game is not in a playable state - we're using this protype as a platform to test ideas for the core gameplay system and AI.

Join our band of researchers as they trek across the galaxy exploring a multitude of procedurally generated biomes, each with their own unique ecosystems and creatures! Explore new worlds, with each playthrough being a new experience. No two levels, no two creatures are exactly the same as the game engine generates not only a new enviroment tailored to its biome, but new creature combinations as well!
